# Netflix Data Analysis Project: 1990s Movies

## Project Overview
This data analysis project explores Netflix's collection of movies from the 1990s, focusing on movie duration patterns and genre classifications. The project uses Python with pandas and NumPy to analyze a comprehensive dataset of Netflix content.

## Key Questions Addressed
The analysis centers on two main questions:
1. What was the most frequent movie duration in the 1990s?
2. How many short action movies (less than 90 minutes) were released in the 1990s?

## Methodology
The analysis follows these steps:
- Loading and examining the Netflix dataset
- Filtering for movies released between 1990-1999
- Analyzing duration frequencies to identify the most common length
- Identifying action movies with durations under 90 minutes
- Storing results in specified variables (duration and short_movie_count)

## Implementation Details
The code uses pandas for data manipulation and filtering operations. Key techniques include:
- Boolean indexing to filter the dataset
- Series value counting to identify frequency patterns
- String pattern matching to identify action movies
- Length calculations to count matching entries

## Extensions
The project could be extended with additional visualizations:
- Histograms of movie durations
- Distribution of genres across the decade
- Year-by-year analysis of movie duration trends
- Comparison of short vs. standard-length films by genre

This project demonstrates fundamental data analysis skills including data filtering, pattern identification, and categorical analysis using Python's data science libraries.
